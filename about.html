            <h1>Music lover. Reader. Adventurist.</h1>
            <p>Pursuing a degree in public relations was one of the best decisions I have ever made. My degree will allow me to both interact with the public and work independently. Image maintainence has been something that interested me from a young age, and I am thrilled to be attending UF to complete my degree.</p>
            <p> When I'm not occupied with school work, I like to spend my time buried in a good novel or traveling the country. I try to combine my traveling with my love of music, so I tend to hit the road with a concert or music festival in mind. I love all types of music and don't ever turn down a concert opportunity- I saw the XX in Jacksonville a few weeks ago.</p>
            <p>Keeping that in mind, I plan on pursuing a carrer focused on event planning. Ideally I would like to become a manager for a musician or band, or even help plan music festivals like Bonnaroo (I've been twice now).</p>
