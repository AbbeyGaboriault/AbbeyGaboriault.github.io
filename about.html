            <h1>Music lover. Reader. Adventurist.</h1>
            <p>Welcome! I'm a Junior studying Public Relations (PR) at the University of Florida. I'm also dual-minoring in English and Sustainabilty.</p>
    <p>I am involved in both school sponsered activities and the Gainesville community. I am a member of the Reitz Union Entertainment Board (RUB) Bands Committee, which provides free entertainemnt to UF students by booking live musical acts such as Of Montreal and Passion Pit.</p>

<p>I also volunteer with Libros de Familia, where my partner and I read books to the children of migrant workers once a week. This is important work, as many of these children are not spoken to at home in English. Their lack of exposure to the Engish language can cause them to fall behind in school.</p>

<p>I am currently interning at the ACORN Clinic as their PR chairperson. The clinic provides low cost medical and dental care to lower income clients. The clinic is getting ready to have it's 40th anniversary, so stay tuned for more news!</p>
<p>Next semester I will continue my work with ACORN, but also serve as one of the PR interns at Southern Legal Counsel, a nonprofit public interest law firm that serves those who would not otherwise have access to legal services and the justice system. </p>
