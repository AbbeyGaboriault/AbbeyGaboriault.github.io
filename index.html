            <h1>Welcome</h1>
            <p>I'm a third year public relations major at the University of Florida with a dual minor in English and environmental studies. 
            <p>In my spare time I enjoy traveling, listening to music, going to concerts and music festivals, and playing with my puppy. I am passionate about environmental conservation and human rights.</p>
            <h2>Life at the University of Florida</h2>
            <p>I am involved in both school sponsered activities and the Gainesville community. I am a member of the Reitz Union Entertainment Board (RUB) Bands Committee, which provides free entertainemnt to UF students by booking live musical acts such as Of Montreal and Passion Pit.</p>
            <p>I also volunteer with Libros de Familia, where my partner and I read books to the children of migrant workers once a week. This is important work, as many of these children are not spoken to at home in English. Their lack of exposure to the Engish language can cause them to fall behind in school.</p>
            <p>I am currently interning at the ACORN Clinic as their PR chairperson. The clinic provides low cost medical and dental care to lower income clients. The clinic is getting ready to have it's 40th anniversary, so stay tuned for more news! </p>
